Fumble Framework.
======

Fumble is a simple little MVC framework project I wrote up and have used as the basis of several projects over the years.
Nothing fancy, just very easy to use.

* It is based on the work of Anant Garg:
  * http://anantgarg.com/2009/03/13/write-your-own-php-mvc-framework-part-1/ 

* Chartbeat challenge:
  * http://cb.jcj.nyc/Chartbeat/trending/gizmodo/15 - this will show the top-10 trending for site gizmodo, compared to 15 minutes ago
  * additional site urls can be added to the SOURCE_URLS json structure in lib/config.php file
  * cron job in crons/importCB.php [site] - import data for site, defaults to SITE_LIST in lib/config.php
